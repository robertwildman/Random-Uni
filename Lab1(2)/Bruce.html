			<h2> Lyrics from Selected Songs </h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Born To Run</h3>
			<p>
			In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream <br>
			At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines <br>
			Sprung from cages out on highway 9, <br>
			Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line<br>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Oh-oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
			<strong> Its a death trap, it's a suicide rap <br>
			We gotta get out while weâ€™re young <br>
			Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run </strong> 
			</p>
		
		
			<h3>Thunder Road</h3>
			<p><strong>
			Well now I'm no hero That's   <br/>
			All the redemption I can offer girl <br/>
			Is beneath this dirty hood <br/>
			</strong>
			With a chance to make it good somehow <br/>
			Hey what else can we do now ? <br/>
			Except roll down the window <br/>
			And let the wind blow back your hair <br/>
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
			<em>
			Well the night's busting open <br/>
			These two lanes will take us anywhere <br/>
			We got one last chance to make it real <br/>
			To trade in these wings on some wheels <br/>
			<strong>Climb in back <br/>
			Heaven's waiting on down the tracks</strong> </em>
			</p>
