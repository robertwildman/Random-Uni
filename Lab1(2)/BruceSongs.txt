Bruce Springsteen 
Lyrics from Selected Songs
Born To Run
In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream 
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on highway 9, 
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin' out over the line 
Oh-oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
Its a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we’re young 
Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 
Thunder Road 
Well now I'm no hero That's understood
All the redemption I can offer girl
Is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey what else can we do now ?
Except roll down the window
And let the wind blow back your hair
Well the night's busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back
Heaven's waiting on down the tracks
